<h4>What is Artemis? </h4>
<p>Artemis is an iOS Bluetooth tracker app that allows you to keep track of things you hold dear. 
   It utilizes Gimbal beacons reconfigured as Apple iBeacons, which are roughly the size of a quarter. </p>

<h3>

<h5> Artemis Capabilities </h5>
<p> Artemis utilizes low energy Bluetooth and iBeacon tech to bring you item-tracking capabilities that extend to about 150 feet. But another feature of Artemis that makes it unique is the Hub technology, which enables the user to track their things that are at home or the office, from anywhere</p>

<h6> Features </h6>
<p>Notifications
The Artemis app features toggleable notifications for each individual tags. When switched on, the app will notify
you should the tag get out of range, and when it comes back into range.
Battery Warnings
The app will notify you if the power level on any particular tag gets too low. </p>

<h7> What are Hubs? </h7>
<p>Hubs are specifically configured Raspberry Pi's that allow users to track their things remotely. 
How do they work?
The Raspberry Pi's that are configured as hubs are equipped with a specific software stack that allow them to keep track of Artemis beacons. Hardware upgrades are also an integral part of this, as Hubs come with both Wifi and BLE antennas, which allow them to track beacons and relay the information to you via your home network. </p>
